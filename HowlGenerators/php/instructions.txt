This PHP output is based on https://phprouter.com/any-route 
Our HowlCode Generator would create a file called index.html based on your definitions.
It will also generate a file called routes.php 

====IMPORTANT====

Make sure you write your own code only in the file that header.tmpl will "include_once" and NOT 
inside routes.php; as that would get over-written whenever you re-run HowlCode.

If you are using Apache, you MUST create a .htaccess file in the root folder of your site.
You can  download .htaccess from  https://github.com/phprouter/main/blob/main/.htaccess 
But please note that the author of that .htaccess seems to have forgotten about .html 
extension and as per their system, even .html would get sent thru their router system.
That would not work here; so please add .html extension also into the excluded extensions.


If you are using Nginx, you would need to set the Nginx configuration. Here is an untested sample:

===Fragment Start===

location / {
    if ($request_filename ~* \.(png|jpg|webp|gif|jpeg|zip|css|svg|js|pdf|html)$) {
        break;
    }

    try_files $uri /routes.php$is_args$args;

  #... other Nginx config 
  
}

===Fragment End=== 

NOTE: There would be other instructions in the Nginx configuration as per your needs.
