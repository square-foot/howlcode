prefixes("hx-","x-")

The following lines are comments. Only the first line is used.
This is for attaching prefixes for the 2nd and 3rd attribute lists. 

Give the prefixes you want to use for the 2nd and 3rd attribute 
lists in the definitions file, as seen in above example. 
Usually you would also need to edit singulars.dat file too, 
if you change these prefixes!
